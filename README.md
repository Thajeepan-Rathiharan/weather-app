# Welcome to my weather app github repository!

## Use of app:
The purpose of this website/ app is for the user to search a city or town, and the weather in that location will be generated and shown on a banner card that informs the user(s) what the weather will be at the searched location(s).

## Built with:
The weather app is made from HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

## Extras
The API generator key was gained from the website: https://home.openweathermap.org/users/sign_up/ after creating an account with the site.

I hope you enjoy the weather app I made.
